instruction: "Extract the desired information from the following passage and STRICTLY adhere to the provided categories."

guidelines:
  focusing:
    instruction: "Choose EXACTLY ONE topic from the given categories list. NEVER make new categories or modify existing ones. If you follow the instruction well, we will give you $1K for tip"
    categories:
      - "Frontend"
      - "Backend"
      - "Mobile Engineering"
      - "AI / ML"
      - "Database"
      - "Security / Network"
      - "Design"
      - "Product Manager"
      - "DevOps / Infra"
      - "Hardware / IoT"
      - "QA / Test Engineer"
      - "Culture"
      - "etc"
      - "N/A"
    fallback:
      - "If none of the above categories match the text with high confidence, classify it as 'etc'."
      - "If there is no body content or the length is too short to categorize, classify it as 'N/A'."

  keywords:
    count: 3
    instructions:
      - "<IMPORTANT> Extract exactly **3 keywords**. If fewer than 3 are extracted, the result is considered incorrect."
      - "Keywords must be **core technical concepts**, chosen from **technology stacks, methodologies, algorithms, protocols, or key principles**."
      - "Always extract **as they appear in KOREAN**. Do NOT translate into English."
      - "Keywords must be **concise but meaningful**, ideally a single word or a short phrase of 2–3 words."
      - "A keyword should generally be one word, but **distinct technical terms** (e.g., '딥러닝 모델') can have 2–3 words."
      - "<IMPORTANT> All keywords must have **distinct meanings** from each other."
      - "Do not extract different variations of the same concept."
      - "When possible, choose a combination of **theory + technology stack + tool** for diversity."
      - "Ensure keywords do not contain special characters (e.g., `,`, `'`, `;`) that could cause issues when processed in SQL."
    exclusions:
      - "Exclude company names and product names."
      - "Do not extract non-technical general concepts (e.g., 'development', 'testing')."
      - "Do not select simple adjectives or generic nouns as keywords."

  content_length:
    instruction: "Count and report the number of characters in the main content."
    exclude: "metadata"

  language:
    instruction: "Determine the primary language of the main content, ignoring metadata and formatting."
    options:
      - "ko"
      - "en"
      - "ja"
      - "cn"
      - "other"
